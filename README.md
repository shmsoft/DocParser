## Development
* For development I prefer IntelliJ.
    * It allows multiple configurations for running and debugging
    * Overall better, I can't say where NetBeans would exceed IntelliJ, except in the UI editor
    * This project has started its life as a Java project and
    was converted to a Scala one

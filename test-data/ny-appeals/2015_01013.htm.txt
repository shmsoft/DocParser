	 The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
Lewis Moore, Jr., Appellant.





Frank J. Nebush, Jr., Public Defender, Utica (Patrick J. Marthage of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Scott D. McNamara, District Attorney, Utica (Steven G. Cox of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Oneida County Court (Michael L. Dwyer, J.),
rendered September 11, 2009. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a nonjury
verdict, of grand larceny in the fourth degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously
affirmed.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him following a nonjury trial
of grand larceny in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 155.30 [1]), defendant
contends that County Court erred in admitting in evidence a spreadsheet listing the value
of jackets stolen from the retail store and that the evidence of the value of the jackets
stolen is legally insufficient to support the conviction. In objecting to the admission of
the exhibit in evidence, defendant contended only that it contradicted the testimony of the
store owner. We thus conclude that defendant failed to preserve for our review his
present contention that the document did not meet the foundational requirements of the
business records exception to the hearsay rule (see People v Evans, 59 AD3d 1127, 1128 [2009], lv
denied 12 NY3d 815 [2009]; see also People v Billip, 65 AD3d 430, 430 [2009], lv
denied 13 NY3d 834 [2009]; People v Sanchez, 260 AD2d 178, 178-179
[1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1026 [1999]). We decline to exercise our power to
review that contention as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (see CPL
470.15 [6] [a]). By making only a general motion to dismiss the indictment, defendant
failed to preserve for our review his contention that the conviction is not supported by
legally sufficient evidence (see People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10, 19 [1995]). In any
event, we conclude that defendant's contention lacks merit. Present—Scudder,
P.J., Fahey, Peradotto, Carni and Whalen, JJ.

Appeal from a judgment (denominated order and judgment) of the Supreme Court,
Monroe County (Evelyn Frazee, J.), entered August 3, 2012 in a CPLR article 78
proceeding and declaratory judgment action. The judgment, inter alia, declared that the
case management fees imposed by defendant-respondent City of Rochester under section
90-21 of the Municipal Code are valid, constitutional and legally imposed.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously reversed on
the law without costs, the motion of petitioners-plaintiffs for summary judgment is
granted, the cross motion of respondents-defendants for summary judgment is denied, the
determinations against petitioners-plaintiffs David Bonis, Deborah Burns and Bruce T.
Henry are annulled and judgment is granted in favor of petitioners-plaintiffs-appellants
as follows: It is adjudged and declared that section 90-21 of the Municipal Code of the
City of Rochester is unconstitutional under the United States and New York
Constitutions.

Memorandum: Petitioners-plaintiffs (petitioners) commenced this hybrid CPLR
article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action seeking, inter alia, to declare
section 90-21 of the Municipal Code of the City of Rochester (Code) unconstitutional.
That section of the Code permits respondent-defendant City of Rochester (City) to collect
a "case management fee" (CMF) of $100 in any case in which a property owner has
failed, for over one year, to comply with a notice and order notifying that owner of Code
violations related to the property (Code § 90-21). The explicit intent of the
CMF is "to obtain some reimbursement for the cost of [property] inspections and to
reduce the number of [notice and order] cases" (§ 90-21 [A]). The CMF is
assessed by the Director of Inspection and Compliance Services (Director) based upon
his or her review of the "case file" (§ 90-21 [F]). A property owner may
protest the CMF "in a writing delivered to the Director . . . within 10
business days from the date of the notice of assessment" (id.). That same Director
must then "review the case file and the written submission of the owner and make a
determination on the protest in writing within 10 business days from the [*2]date of the protest" (id.). The determination of the
Director "shall be the final determination of the City . . . and shall be subject
to review pursuant to [CPLR] [a]rticle 78" (id.). In the event that the CMF
remains unpaid after 60 days, it shall become a lien against the property and, if unpaid on
May 1, shall be added to the property taxes for that property (see
§ 90-21 [D]).

Respondent-defendant Gary Kirkmire, in his official capacity as the Director,
imposed CMFs on petitioners, although he eventually waived the CMFs imposed on
certain petitioners, finding that those CMFs were erroneously imposed. After petitioners
commenced this proceeding/action, they moved for summary judgment on the
petition/complaint and sought a judgment declaring that section 90-21 is invalid, that it
impermissibly authorizes the imposition of the CMF without a trial and that defendants
may not collect the CMF from property owners in the City or place an unpaid CMF on
the property tax bills. Respondents-defendants (respondents) moved to dismiss the
petition/complaint, and Supreme Court issued an order converting that motion, upon the
consent of the parties, into a cross motion for summary judgment. The court also
enjoined the City from imposing any further CMFs on petitioners or placing any further
CMFs, penalties or interest on petitioners' property tax bills.

Following additional submissions by the parties, the court issued a judgment
declaring that section 90-21 is constitutional and that the CMFs imposed by section
90-21 were valid and were constitutionally and legally imposed. The court further
vacated the injunction previously imposed, concluded that petitioners were not denied
procedural due process and confirmed the determinations of the Director with respect to
petitioners David Bonis, Deborah Burns and Bruce T. Henry, for whom the CMFs were
not waived. We now reverse.

The appealing petitioners contend that the CMF imposed by Code
§ 90-21 is, in actuality, a fine, and that it is imposed upon property owners
without due process. We agree. Although "[t]he exceedingly strong presumption of
constitutionality applies . . . to ordinances of municipalities[,]
. . . [that] presumption is rebuttable" (Lighthouse Shores v Town of
Islip, 41 NY2d 7, 11-12 [1976]; see Matter of Turner v Municipal Code Violations Bur. of City of
Rochester, 122 AD3d 1376, 1377 [2014]), and we conclude that petitioners
have rebutted the presumption of constitutionality. We therefore reverse the judgment
and grant judgment in favor of the appealing petitioners, declaring that section 90-21 is
unconstitutional.

A determination whether the CMF is a fee or a fine imposed as a penalty is critical to
our analysis because "[p]rocedural due process rights do not apply to legislation of
general applicability," and thus the imposition of fees such as licensing fees are "not
subject to attack on grounds of procedural due process. Fines [that are imposed as a
penalty], however, can implicate procedural due process rights" (Jones v
Wildgen, 320 F Supp 2d 1116, 1127 [D Kan 2004], reconsideration granted in
part on other grounds 349 F Supp 2d 1358 [2004]; see Twin Lakes Dev. Corp. v Town
of Monroe, 1 NY3d 98, 106-107 [2003], cert denied 541 US 974
[2004]). Respondents contend that the CMF is a fee charged in exchange for a service or
benefit, i.e., the numerous inspections of the property while the notice and order is in
effect. In our view, the CMF is the equivalent of a fine imposed as a penalty, i.e., a sum
of money required to be paid as a result of either "doing some act which is prohibited, or
omitting to do some act which is required to be done" (City of Buffalo v
Neubeck, 209 App Div 386, 388 [1924]; see Matter of Dumbarton Oaks Rest.
& Bar v New York State Liq. Auth., 58 NY2d 89, 93-94 [1983]). The CMF is
assessed only after respondents have determined that a property owner has violated the
Code in the first instance and that the property owner has failed to abate those violations
within one year.

It is well settled that states may not "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law" (US Const, 14th Amend, § 1; see NY
Const, art I, § 6). Having concluded that the CMF is a fine imposed as a
penalty on the property owner, we must determine whether the ordinance provides
property owners with due process of law. As the Court of Appeals wrote in
Morgenthau v Citisource, Inc. (68 NY2d 211 [1986]), "[w]e have long
recognized that 'due process is a flexible constitutional concept calling for such
procedural protections as a particular situation may demand' . . . [,] and in
determining whether [f]ederal due process standards have been met, we look to the three
distinct factors that form the balancing test enunciated by the Supreme Court in
Mathews v Eldridge (424 US 319, 335 [1976]): 'First, the private interest that
will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of
such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or
substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the
function [*3]involved and the fiscal and administrative
burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail' "
(id. at 221).

While we agree with the court that the private interest at stake, i.e., $100, "is
relatively insubstantial," we conclude that there is a significant risk of erroneous
deprivation of that interest through the procedures established by the ordinance.
Petitioners submitted evidence establishing that, of the 583 CMFs challenged, 392 were
voided. Indeed, as noted above, three of the petitioners had their CMFs waived as
erroneously imposed. We reject the contention of respondents that such evidence
establishes that the procedures are "obviously effective." In our view, it establishes a
serious flaw in the system.

Although " '[d]ue process does not, of course, require that the defendant in
every civil case actually have a hearing on the merits' " (Curiale v Ardra Ins.
Co., 88 NY2d 268, 274 [1996], quoting Boddie v Connecticut, 401 US 371,
378 [1971]), we conclude that due process requires some type of hearing at which the
City should be required to establish that property owners did not abate the violation
within the one-year period. Evidence in the record establishes that there may be
significant disputes between property owners and inspectors concerning whether a
violation has been satisfactorily abated. Inasmuch as the determination whether
compliance has been achieved is made solely by City officials, the procedures established
by section 90-21 do not provide a sufficient opportunity for the property owner to
challenge that determination (see Matter of Hecht v Monaghan, 307 NY 461,
469-470 [1954]; see also Jones, 320 F Supp 2d at 1127-1129). Moreover, the
City official reviewing the written protest is the same official who assessed the CMF in
the first instance. Contrary to the contention of respondents, the availability of a CPLR
article 78 proceeding does not establish that the statute provides sufficient procedural due
process because such proceedings "presuppose administrative procedures that conform
with due process requirements" (People v David W., 95 NY2d 130, 140 [2000];
cf. Matter of County of Broome
[Ritter], 86 AD3d 817, 819 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 716 [2011]).

Finally, we reject respondents' contention that additional procedural safeguards, such
as a hearing, would be too costly and unduly burdensome. Indeed, we note that such
hearings are provided in the red-light traffic cases where the penalty is $50 (see Krieger v City of
Rochester, 42 Misc 3d 753, 770-771 [2013]; see generally Vehicle and
Traffic Law § 1111-b et seq.).

In view of our determination, we do not address the appealing petitioners' remaining
contentions or the contention raised in the amicus brief. Present—Scudder, P.J.,
Fahey, Peradotto, Carni and Whalen, JJ.

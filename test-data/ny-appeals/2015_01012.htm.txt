	 The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
Christine L. Coppeta, Appellant.





Timothy P. Donaher, Public Defender, Rochester (Kimberly F. Duguay of counsel),
for defendant-appellant.

Sandra Doorley, District Attorney, Rochester (Daniel Gross of counsel), for
respondent.





Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Monroe County (Joseph D.
Valentino, J.), rendered June 15, 2010. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury
verdict, of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree (two counts).

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously
affirmed.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting her, upon a jury verdict, of
two counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree (Penal Law
§ 175.35), defendant's sole contention is that Supreme Court erred in
denying her motion for a mistrial on the ground that the testimony of a witness that a
bracelet was missing from the witness's residence was Molineux evidence and
was improperly admitted because she did not receive the requisite notice of the
testimony. We conclude that defendant's contention is without merit because the
testimony did not implicate defendant in the commission of any uncharged crime and
thus it did not constitute Molineux evidence (see People v Hillard, 79 AD3d 1757, 1758 [2010], lv
denied 17 NY3d 796 [2011]; see generally People v Arafet, 13 NY3d 460, 464-465
[2009]). Present—Scudder, P.J., Fahey, Peradotto, Carni and Whalen, JJ.
